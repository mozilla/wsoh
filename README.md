Welcome to WSOH and we're looking forward to a great night of hacking with all of you! Below are instructions for WSOH, including projects themes, participating companies, judging criteria, prizes, and so on. 
prizes, and the judging criteria. For those of you needing transportation, fill out the SurveyMonkey (see Transportation section at the end).


Getting Started:
----------------
- All projects (with team composition) must be submitted on the [Etherpad document][1] before July 22nd
  (make sure you save each time and be careful not overwriting others edits)
- No more than 4 members per team ; individual contributors welcome too.
- If you have a project and need more members on your team, please indicate the type of technical skills set you're looking for. Please add your contact info so students can reach you.
- For those of you who don't have a project/idea, nor a team, please find one and add yourself on the Etherpad
- For your official entry, fork this project and commit your code to the fork. We'll be able to see the list of submissions via the Network Graph.


Instructions:
-------------
- You may start hacking on your project as early as today (7/15)
- On July 22/23, you may hack on your project from 7.30pm until 7.30am
- Show & Tell will start promptly at 8am on the 23rd and each team will have 2min to present


Projects Themes:
----------------
For WSOH we chose to focus on projects and challenges that advance the Web for everyone, while keeping it open, decentralized, interoperable, people-centric, and fun. Projects are not limited to these themes, so enjoy yourself and build something awesome. After all, hacking is about scratching an itch, and really, no one else can tell you where to scratch, or what tools to scratch with:

* Build something interesting with HTML 5 & video technology
* Build something that enables cross-device sharing or social interaction
* Data visualization - use data to tell an interesting story in a new way, reveal something new
* Build something interesting that leverages user identity and the social graph
* Build a browser extension (bonus points if it maps to one of the above: social, identity, datavis)
* A vast amount of information online is locked up inside PDFs, Word documents, and so on. Scribd can convert this to pure HTML5 — use the embedding API to expose this information from your favorite data source! (http://www.scribd.com/developers)
* Best use of the [Google Maps Javascript API V3](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/)
* Build something that syncs dropbox with another service (flickr, facebook, gmail)
* Build another interface into dropbox (sftp dropbox server, webdav, fuse, gvfs, browser extension, public share website, twitter-like dropbox webpage)
* Build something that uses data mashups from the Yahoo! Query Language (YQL) in interesting ways
    * The background documentation for YQL is available at http://developer.yahoo.com/yql and the test console is available at http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console
* Hardware hack: using hardware/an unexpected device to do one of the above
* Open challenge: could be anything (be creative!)
