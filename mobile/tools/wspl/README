How to run the tests:

* The tests themselves assume that jsunit is in a sibling directory
to the one containing the distrbution. If this is not so, it is sufficient
to edit the paths in the test files. (On UNIX, symlinks may be your 
friend if this is not convenient.)

* jsmock.js (available from http://jsmock.sourceforge.net/) should
be placed in the distribution directory.

* Specify the test files via a URL parameter. (This might be an issue
with jsunit: http://digitalmihailo.blogspot.com/2008/06/make-jsunit-work-in-firefox-30.html)

For example, if the root of your downloaded of the distribution is /mypath:

file:///mypath/jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=mypath/webstorageportabilitylayer/dbwrapper_gears_test.html
file:///mypath/jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=mypath/webstorageportabilitylayer/dbwrapper_html5_test.html
file:///mypath/jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=mypath/webstorageportabilitylayer/dbwrapperapi_test.html

NB: the leading / in a UNIX path is not included in mypath so setting
it via pwd will not deliver the desired effect.
